# adm  

cdm fails to start x when i log in as someone else than root and i'm too lazy to fix it so i made this.  
It's a display manager. But you should use CDM or a graphical one.
You can append the script to ~/.bash_profile and disable your display manager if you want but there's no reason anyone would ever want to use this.
