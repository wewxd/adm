## adm  

A basic script i use as a display manager because CDM is unable to start an X session when i log in as someone else than root, and writing this is easier than fixing CDM.  
I didn't want a graphical display manager, and i wanted the display manager to only be launched when i log in tty1.  
If you want to use it you can disable your actual display manager and append the script to ~/.bash_profile or /etc/profile
